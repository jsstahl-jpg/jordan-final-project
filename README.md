# jordan-final-project

I will build a simple, single-page "Daily Habit Tracker." The interface will allow a user to click buttons for 4-5 simple, pre-set habits (e.g., "Drank Water," "Read 30 Min," "Went Outside"). The system will update a simple running score or counter on the screen.&nbsp;

The core technical challenge is demonstrating proficient DOM manipulation using;jQuery/JavaScript(Week 7). I will use jQuery events to track button clicks, update the counter text in real-time, and maybe toggle a "completed" style on the button. The design focus will be on accessibility and strong styling for forms/inputs(Week 5), ensuring the buttons and counter area are highly visible and intuitive across all device sizes. The target audience is students who need a minimal, satisfying way to track simple daily


Timeline:

My timeline for Week 10 is focused entirely on finalizing and submitting the Individual Final Project. First, I need to complete the jQuery functionality, ensuring the score updates correctly and the buttons toggle status with clean CSS Transitions. After the code is complete, I will shift to Quality Assurance and Debugging, which involves rigorously testing the responsiveness on mobile, tablet, and desktop views to confirm my Flexbox layout scales without issues. Finally, the last step is Deployment, where I will upload the final files to my GitHub repository and host the site via GitHub Pages to generate the live URL needed for the submission, along with writing a brief README file documenting the technical implementation.
