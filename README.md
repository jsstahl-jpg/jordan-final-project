SecurePass Generator & Analyzer

🌟 Project Overview & Proposal

The goal of this project is to design and build a functional and aesthetically pleasing Password Generator and Strength Analyzer web application. This is a comprehensive front-end exercise utilizing only core technologies to showcase my fundamental skills.

The application will feature a user-friendly interface for defining password criteria (length, character types) and will provide real-time, visual feedback on the strength of both generated and user-typed passwords.

🎯 Technical Goals (Skills Showcase)

Semantic HTML: Establishing a clear, accessible, and structured foundation for all inputs and display elements.

Responsive CSS: Implementing a modern, intuitive, and responsive layout using Flexbox for alignment and CSS Transitions for visual feedback (especially for the strength meter).

JavaScript: Demonstrating mastery of randomization algorithms, string manipulation, DOM manipulation for dynamic updates, and robust event handling.

👤 Target Audience

Primary Audience: General internet users seeking a fast, reliable, and trustworthy tool for creating strong credentials.

Secondary Audience: Technical evaluators and potential employers looking for a practical, clean demonstration of front-end development proficiency.
